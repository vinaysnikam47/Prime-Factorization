# Python 3 Projects #


This repository contains python 3 projects.

#### Some details: ####
* Programming language used to complete this project is Python.
* Way of completing this projects may not be best but it is one of the good ways.
* This readme file will be updated with links as soon as project file added in the specific folder.

__Note__: All coding of this project files has been carried out in windows operating system. So some projects may not work in other operating system. Reason behind this is sometimes different commands need to be executed for different operating system to complete the same task.

#### I am creating this repository because I want to learn Python language quickly. ####

[Happy Numbers](https://github.com/vinaysnikam47/Python-3-Projects/blob/master/Numbers/happy_numbers.py) - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.
